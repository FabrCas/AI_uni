Draw the rst 3 steps of the tree generated by forward search assuming a perfect heuristic (a heuristic
choosing the move in the plan given above). Show all the actions applicable at each of the traversed
states, and the state reached.

A (Root)= INIT = {(with georgie boat) (with clown ballon) (at georgie p0) (at clown p6)}
actions applicable: moveGeorgie, moveClown
B= Succ(A,moveGeorgie) = {(with georgie boat) (with clown ballon) (at georgie p1) (at clown p6)}
actions applicable: moveGeorgie, moveClown, drop 
C =Succ(B,drop) = { (free georgie) (onGround p0 boat)(with clown ballon) (at georgie p1) (at clown p6)}
action applicable: moveGeorgie, moveClown, pick
D = Succ(C,moveGeorgie) = {(free georgie) (onGround p0 boat)(with clown ballon) (at georgie p0) (at clown p6)}
